Please download dataset from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debanga/facial-expression-recognition-challenge

The CSV with useful information should be the \icml_face_data.csv file or similar.
This is the file that wants to be fed into the dataset_cleaning.py file. 
All paths in the python files are for my machine so will need to be changed - most of the paths are contained just after the os module import and everything is assumed to be in this file.
